A MERN stack social network app for Artists around the world

Join me as I code a **fullstack application**, starting from create-react-app. I will be creating a secure login/signup system with json web tokens, a forum for users to create posts and share artwork, and a connection between artists who would like to follow activity of their peers more closely.
